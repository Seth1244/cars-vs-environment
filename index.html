        <h3> Key facts</h3>

        <p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Fossil fuels are the world’s dominant energy source, making up 82% of the global energy supply.
                4
                 Non-OECD countries hold the majority of proven reserves for all fossil fuels.
                5
                These energy sources have powered, and continue to power, the industrialization of nations. 
                They have a variety of applications, from electricity production to transport fuel.  Moreover,
                fossil fuels are necessary for the production of a variety of common products,such as paints, detergents, polymers (including plastics), cosmetics and some medicines.
                
                Some fossil fuels, such as coal, are an abundant and cheap form of energy. Others,like oil, have a variable cost depending on geographic location. For this reason,
                 geopolitical issues arise due to the geographic allocation of these highly valuable resources.
                
                Fossil fuels are non-renewable resources, as they have taken millions of years to form. Once these resources are used,
                they will not be replenished. Moreover, fossil fuels are the largest source of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas which contributes to climate change,
                and their production causes both environmental and human health impacts. These concerns are triggering the world to look at alternate sources of energy that are both less harmful   
                and renewable. Additionally, the gradual depletion of conventional fossil fuel reserves has led companies to develop more challenging reserves.
                These unconventional resources usually have higher production costs and a greater risk of environmental impact.

    <h2>OUR WORLD:
        <p>Who does climate change affect?<br>
        Climate change is devastating people's lives all over the world. With drought, storms, floods, crop damage and
         sea-level rise, millions are fleeing their homes. And it's the world’s poorest who are hardest hit.
        
        The UN Refugee Agency says climate change adds to many of today’s conflicts — from Somalia to Syria.
        
        The effects will get worse as temperatures rise further. So we must cut greenhouse gas emissions to stop temperatures rising.
        
        People also need protection from the climate change we can no longer avoid. That means financial support 
        for developing countries and legal protection for climate refugees.</p>
    </h2>
    <h2>YOUR COMMITMENTS:<P>
        Want to help stop global warming? <br>Here are 10 simple things you can do and how much carbon dioxide you'll save doing them.
        Change a light
        Replacing one regular light bulb with a compact fluorescent light bulb will save 150 pounds of carbon dioxide a year. 
        
        Drive less 
        Walk, bike, carpool or take mass transit more often. You'll save one pound of carbon dioxide for every mile you don't drive!
        
        Recycle more
        You can save 2,400 pounds of carbon dioxide per year by recycling just half of your household waste.
        
        Check your tires
        Keeping your tires inflated properly can improve your gas mileage by more than 3 percent. Every gallon of gasoline saved keeps 20 pounds of
        carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
        
        Use less hot water
        It takes a lot of energy to heat water. Use less hot water by taking shorter and cooler showers and washing your clothes in cold or warm instead of 
        hot water (more than 500 pounds of carbon dioxide saved per year).
        
        Avoid products with a lot of packaging
        You can save 1,200 pounds of carbon dioxide if you reduce your garbage by 10 percent.
        
        Adjust your thermostat
        Moving your thermostat down just 2 degrees in winter and up 2 degrees in summer could save about 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year.
        
        Plant a tree
        A single tree will absorb one ton of carbon dioxide over its lifetime.
        
        Turn off electronic devices
        Simply turning off your television, DVD player, stereo, and computer, when you're not using them, will save you thousands of pounds of carbon dioxide a year.

</P>

    <h2>OUR COMMITMENTS AND GOALS:
        <p>
            Nissan has set the goal to achieve carbon neutrality across the company's operations and the life cycle of its products by 2050.
            <br> As part of this effort, by the early 2030s, every all-new Nissan vehicle offering in key markets will be electrified.
           <br> We want to build evidence on what innovations work to reduce the health effects of air pollution equitably,
            particularly at a local level with our cars. <br>
            Why don't you join us into the future. Come and see what we have on offer.
